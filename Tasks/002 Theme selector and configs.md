# Problem
Theme configurations are not localized to the application directory, and instead are pointing to system configs outside the repo. Plus, there's no theme selector on the TUI.

# Expectation
I'm able to switch themes from the TUI itself, and the theme updates. I have the initially designed four themes to select from.
