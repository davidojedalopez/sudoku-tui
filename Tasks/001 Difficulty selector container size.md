# Problem
The difficulty selector changes its container size when the selector is on different difficulties because the description on the bottom gets longer or shorter depending on the difficulty. 

# Expectation
The container should remain the same size independent of the difficulty selected, to avoid the UI from changing and moving when moving through the options.
