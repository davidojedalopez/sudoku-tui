## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

Fix @"Tasks/005 Puzzle library UI.md"

### Prompt 2

I don't think that fixed it, as I still see it wrong. I added an image of the app even with this change. Check if we're not having an issue with the width of the container.

### Prompt 3

Looking neat. I added another image; please fix the top border of the containers, as it is displaced to the right.

### Prompt 4

With this fix, we're now cutting off the text from the Sudoku puzzle selector (look at image for evidence). Fix that, and make sure not to break other things. If you need to increase the max width of the containers, do so.

### Prompt 5

Okay, commit and push.
